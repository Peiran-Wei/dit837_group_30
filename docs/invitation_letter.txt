Hello! 

We are Annan Lao and Peiran Wei, third-year students studying software engineering in the University of Gothenburg and we are currently conducting a bachelor’s thesis on personal sustainability in software engineering with a focus on self-care practices’ influence on software engineers.

We are seeking 50 volunteers from your community, as we are running a survey for our thesis and need 100 volunteers in total. The study includes one common part (questionnaires) and one optional follow part (interview, online or off-line). The intervention takes place between the end of March and the end of April. 

We will request you to fill out a questionnaire both before and after the intervention. During the four weeks within the intervention period, we would like you to take a mindful relaxation on the platform including Insight Timer or Calm or Headspace for 10 minutes per day and at least 6 times per week including weekends. Voluntary withdrawal can happen anytime though we do encourage you to stay the whole period.

By the end of April, there will be a follow-up questionnaire for you to fill out. We also will include the link to the interview at the end of the second questionnaire. It’s voluntary, but we highly encourage you to give your input.

The survey, with a possible follow-up interview, will be anonymous but we give credits to participants in our published thesis. We kindly ask you to participate as it would be really helpful for us to conduct our thesis and we would highly appreciate your participation.

You can contact us via email if you wish to participate.
